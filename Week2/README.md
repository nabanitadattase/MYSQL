Part 1 : More SQL queries through JS program

Write a node-JS program to get answers of following queries on the new_world database: Note that you are expected to get the input from user and use prepared statements to write the queries.

What is the capital of country X ? (Accept X from user)

List all the languages spoken in the region Y (Accept Y from user)

Find the number of cities in which language Z is spoken (Accept Z from user)

Are there any countries that have A) Same official language B) Same region If yes, display those countries. If no, display TRUE or FALSE

List all the continents with the number of languages spoken in each continent

Part 2 : SQL research

I want to get alerts when a country has >= 10 languages. E.g. If a country X has 9 languages in the CountryLanguage table, and a user INSERTs one more row in the CountryLanguage table, then I should get an alert. How can I achieve this ?

Write the necessary SQL statements for this solution and

Test your solution with example insert statements.

Part 3 : Database design

I want to develop a ToDo app in which a user can create a multiple ToDo lists with different purposes. Each list has at least one item. Each item can be tagged. Each item can be marked completed. There could be reminders for some items.

Draw an Entity Relationship Diagram for the database of the ToDo App.
